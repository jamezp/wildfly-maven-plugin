# Usage

The ${project.name} is generally used to deploy applications or application artifacts to a running ${appServerName} Application
Server. Each goal can be explicitly executed from the command line or specified in the execution portion of the plugin
in the POM file.

#[[##]]# The `${pluginPrefix}:add-resource` Goal

The `${pluginPrefix}:add-resource` goal adds a resource to the running ${appServerName} Application Server.

For example to add a resource you type the following on the command line:

```
mvn ${pluginPrefix}:add-resource
```

#[[##]]# The `${pluginPrefix}:deploy` Goal

The `${pluginPrefix}:deploy` goal deploys the application to the running ${appServerName} Application Server.

For example to deploy, or redeploy by default, you type the following on the command line:

```
mvn ${pluginPrefix}:deploy
```

#[[##]]# The `${pluginPrefix}:deploy-only` Goal

The `${pluginPrefix}:deploy-only` goal deploys the application to the running ${appServerName}  without executing
any other goals by default.

For example to deploy, or redeploy by default, you type the following on the command line:

```
mvn ${pluginPrefix}:deploy-only
```

#[[##]]# The `${pluginPrefix}:deploy-artifact` Goal

The `${pluginPrefix}:deploy-artifact` goal deploys an arbitrary artifact to the running ${appServerName}.

For example to deploy the arbitrary artifact specified in you POM, you type the following on the command line:

```
mvn ${pluginPrefix}:deploy-artifact
```

#[[##]]# The `${pluginPrefix}:dev` Goal

The `${pluginPrefix}:dev` goal will start ${appServerName} and deploy your application. If the `jboss-home`
property is not set, a server will be provisioned. The source directories will be watched for changes. If a change
occurs, additional Maven goals may be executed before a possible redeploy of your deployment.

For example to run your WAR in development mode, you enter the following on the command line:

```
mvn ${pluginPrefix}:dev
```

deployed to the application server.

To execute the redeploy goal type the following on the command line:

```
mvn ${pluginPrefix}:redeploy
```

#[[##]]# The `${pluginPrefix}:redeploy-only` Goal

#[[##]]# The `${pluginPrefix}:start` Goal
