            <question>Why are archived server downloads being deprecated?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    In 3.0.0 new goals will be introduced to allow provisioning a server. WildFly Galleon has come a long
                    way and it is the preferred means of creating a server. For this reason, the downloading of a server
                    by means of a Maven artifact will be removed in 3.0.0.

        <faq id="autoReload">
            <question>Why is my server reloading after I execute CLI commands?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    In 4.2.1 a new configuration parameter, <code>auto-reload</code>, was added which automatically
                    reloads the running server if <code>offline</code> is set to <code>false</code> and the command
                    left the server in a state of <code>reload-required</code>. If you previously had a reload operation
                    or command in your script or command list, you can now remove it. The other option would be to set
                    the <code>auto-reload</code> configuration to <code>false</code>.
